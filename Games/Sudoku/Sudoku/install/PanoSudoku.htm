<p>Panoramic Ultimate Sudoku features five challenging logic-based number puzzle games: Sudoku, Killer Sudoku, Kakuro, 
KenKen &amp; Greater Than. In Sudoku the goal of the game is to fill the cells of a nine by nine grid with the digits 1 through 9. Kakuro combines the elements of Sudoku with the strategy of a crossword puzzle. Except the crossword clues are the total sum of all of the values in each vertical or horizontal section.
Killer Sudoku combines elements of Sudoku with Kakuro - no initial numbers are given, but the nine by nine grid is divided into regions, each with a number that the sum of all numbers in the region must add up to and with no repeated numerals. These must be filled in while obeying the standard rules of Sudoku.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Five (5) Challenging games included: Sudoku, Killer Sudoku, Kakuro, KenKen 
	&amp; Greater Than</li>
  <li>Ten (10) Skins to choose from with multiple background colors</li>
  <li>Choose or take a picture with your device camera and set that as your game background image</li>
  <li>Over 1 billion possible puzzles</li>
  <li>Game state always saved, even when you turn off your phone</li>
  <li>Five (5) difficulty settings</li>
  <li>Kakuro offers three (3) grid sizes</li>

<p>Sudoku is a logical number placement puzzle game.  The goal is to enter the numbers 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9 by 9 grid made up from nine 3 by 3 sub grids.  The challenge is to place the numbers so each subgrid of 3 by 3 only has one instance of each number. As well, each vertical and each horizontal row of nine can only have one instance of each number.</p>
<p><b><a name="Kakuro" id="Sudoku2"></a><font size="4">Kakuro</font></b></p>
<p>Kakuro is crossword style number placement puzzle game. The goal is to enter a number from 1 through 9 in each empty cell of a grid, which is made up of a variable number of empty cells.  The challenge is to place the numbers so each horizontal or vertical line only has up to one instance of any number with a total sum equal to the total values given to the left of the empty cells for the horizontal and above for the vertical.</p>
<p><b><a name="Killer" id="Sudoku3"></a><font size="4">Killer Sudoku</font></b></p>
<p>Killer Sudoku is a number placement puzzle game with attributes from both Sudoku and Kakuro.  The goal is to enter the numbers 1 through 
  9 in each cell of a 9 by 9 grid made up from nine 3 by 3 sub grids.  The challenge is to place the numbers so each subgrid of 3 by 3 only has one instance of each number.  As well, each vertical and each horizontal row of nine can have only one instance of each number as well.  With Killer Sudoku, the values within each outlined grouping must also add up to make the exact total given for each outline.</p>

<p><b><a name="KenKen" id="Sudoku4"></a><font size="4">KenKen</font></b></p>
<p>Similar to Killer Sudoku, except all four mathematical operators (+-*/) are used.
<p><b><a name="Greater" id="Sudoku5"></a><font size="4">Greater Than</font></b></p>
Greater Than is a variant of Sudoku in which hints are provided by "greater than" symbols which show the relationship between adjacent numbers
by indicating which number is greater. Each 3x3 subgrid must also contain each number from 1 to 9, and each row and column must contain 
one instance of each number from 1 to 9.
