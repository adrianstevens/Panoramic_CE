<a name="HowTo"></a><font size="6"><b>How To Play</b></font></p>
<p><b>The game of FreeCell</b>
<p>When the game begins, the cards are shuffled into columns and usually only 
the top cards are moveable. This can be changed by stacking cards in order from 
high to low, in alternating colors. The object of the game is to stack all the 
cards, in order by value (Ace to King) and suit, onto the four empty spaces 
(Foundations) at the top right - just like solitaire. However, this is not so 
easy as you only have access to certain cards on each stack. There are four 
empty cells at the top left where you can place cards in order to move cards 
around more effectively. Only one card may be on each of these cells 
- no stacks allowed.
While stacks can be moved, it depends on how many cells 
at the top left are free, as this is merely a shortcut to moving them one-by-one 
from one spot to the other, via the empty cells. For instance, a stack of six 
cards cannot be moved unless there are additional spaces free where you have 
cleared columns. You may move any card or stack of cards onto the free cell that 
is uncovered when you clear a column. Any move can be reversed using the Undo button, even moves that AutoComplete helps you with. However, only the previous move can be undone, so don't play too hastily!</p>
<p>AutoComplete automatically moves Aces to the Foundations for you, and also moves applicable cards that may no longer be useful to you to the Foundations. But be aware that cards that are 
moved to the Foundations cannot be moved back. You may turn AutoComplete off in the Options menu.</p>
<p>SmartStack is a smart feature that moves stacks for you. When you select a card that is at the top of a stack, and select a destination that is for more cards than one, SmartStack moves the
correct cards for you. If you may move either a stack or a single card, SmartStack asks you which you would prefer.</p>
<p><b>Baker's Game</b> is played much like FreeCell except you can only place cards of the same suit on top of each other in the columns making this game more difficult.  Approximately 20% of the deals are solvable.</p>
<p><b>KingCell</b> has similar rules to FreeCell except it does not require alternate colors when placing cards on to each other in columns.  This game is easier than FreeCell.  Traditionally it is played with the
"Kings only in empty spaces" option on.</p>
<p><b>Four Colors</b> follows the same rules as Freecell but all 52 cards are dealt into the first four (4) columns and only seven (7) columns are available.  The game is more difficult than FreeCell and about 60% of the deals are solvable.</b>

<a name="Options"></a><font size="6"><b>Options</b></font></p>
<p>To access the options, select the options button from the Menu screen.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game type: </b>Select a game to play from FreeCell, Baker's Game, KingCell and Four Colors.
<li><b>Table Color: </b>Choose the background color 
(blue, green, purple, red, and orange)
<li><b>Play Sounds: </b>Toggle the sound on and off
<li><b>Auto Complete: </b>
Turn Auto Complete on/off
<li><b>Available FreeCells: </b>Choose 2, 3, or 4 (default) FreeCells in all games
<li><b>Kings only in empty spaces: </b>Strict play where only hi cards can be moved to empty columns
<li><b>Invert card order: </b>Reverses the order of the values of the cards for all game modes
</ul>
<p>Reducing the number of FreeCells increases the game difficulty.  On traditional FreeCell, over 99.9% of the deals are solvable with four (4) FreeCells, 93% are solvable with three (3) and about 78% are solvable with two (2).</p>
<p>Enabling Kings only in empty spaces is the original method of playing FreeCell.  Although it increases the difficulty, it has very little effect on which games are solvable.</p>
<p>Invert card order has no effect on the difficulty but makes for an interesting new twist on the game of FreeCell.</p>
