<a name="HowTo"></a><font size="6"><b>How To Play</b></font></p>
<p><b>The game of Video Poker</b></p>
<p>Panoramic Video Poker plays just like casino video poker machines.  The goal of the game is to get the highest value poker hand.  All payoffs are based on five card poker hands.</p>
<p>Different game types award different payouts, for the game Jacks or Better, the payouts are as follows:</p>
  1 to 1 - Pair of Jacks or Better<br>
  2 to 1 - Two Pairs<br>
  3 to 1 - Three of a Kind<br>
  4 to 1 - Straight<br>
  6 to 1 - Flush<br>
  9 to 1 - Full House<br>
 25 to 1 - Four of a Kind<br>
 50 to 1 - Straight Flush<br>
800 to 1 - Royal Flush*<br>
<p>*Note - In order to get the maximum payout on the Royal Flush you must play the maxium bet.  Otherwise the payout is 250 to 1.<p>
<p>Start by selecting a bet amount.  Press the "Bet One" button up to 5 times or press the "Max Bet" button.  If the "Max Bet" button is pressed, the maximum bet will be chosen and the game will start.  Otherwise you will need to press the "Deal" button to begin.</p>
<p>Once the cards are dealt, you may press on the cards to hold them.  Press the "Deal" button again to draw cards for any that aren't being held.</p>
<p>Your hand will then be evaluated and you will be paid out according to the payout table.  You will also see the amount you've won in the Bet display.</p>
<p><b>Multi-play Video Poker</b></p>
<p>You may choose to play multi-hand poker from the Options screen.  Multi-play Video Poker is played the same manner as single hand Video Poker and three (3) or Five (5) times your bet amount will be drawn from the bank depending on the number of hands played.</p>
<p>You will initially be dealt one hand, if you chose to hold any cards, they will be added too and held for all hands.  When you draw additional  cards, cards will be dealt for each hand.  Note that each Video Poker hand's cards are drawn from a uniquely shuffled deck.  You will receive payouts from all hands and your total winnings will be displayed in the bet area.</p>
<p><b>Stud Poker</b><p>
<p>In Stud Poker you place your bet and then your cards are dealt as in other Video Poker game types, however only four (4) cards are initially dealt.  You then have the option of doubling your bet by pressing the "X2" button or continuing by pressing the "Deal" button.  Payouts will be made according to the payout table.  Note that payouts for Stud Video Poker are higher than other variations.</p>
<p>The game is over when you run out of credits or you "break the bank" (over 9,999,999).</p>
