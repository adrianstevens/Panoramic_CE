<a name="Overview"></a><font size="6"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p>Panoramic HexeGems is a highly addictive logic-based puzzle game using four hexagon gems pieces (HexeGems) placed together in blocks. The goal of the game is to manipulate the HexeGem blocks by moving them side to side and rotating them  to create a horizontal line without any gaps. Earn as many points as you can before the HexeGems pile up and reach the top of the screen. Gain bonus points by clearing a line that contains an glowing orb. Each complete line that you make clears 
away that row of gems and gets you closer to moving to the next level. Watch out, advancing levels means increased speed! </p>

<p><b>The game of HexeGems</b></p>
<p>The goal of the game is to manipulate the HexeGem blocks by moving them side to side and rotating them  to create a horizontal line without any gaps. Each time a horizontal line is created the row will disappear and points are awarded. As you advance to new levels the rate at which the HexeGems fall increases. If you are able to eliminate more than one row with a single HexeGem block, bonus points are awarded. Sometimes, a HexeGem block will contain a glowing Orb. Clear a line containing a glowing Orb and receive extra bonus points. Placing two Orbs side by side will  result in an explosion, producing a generous amount of bonus points.

<p>There is a "preview shadow" shown where the piece will land if it continues falling at its current position and orientation.</p>
<p>The game is over when the pieces stack up to the top of the screen. </p>
<p><b>Controls</b></p>
<p>You can play HexeGems using the 5-way control on your mobile phone or device.  Press Left or Right to move the pieces left or right.  Press Up to rotate the HexGem block through all  orientations and press 
Down to make the piece fall faster.  Extra points are awarded if you press Down as the pieces fall.</p>
<p>You are able to switch the falling HexeGem block with a new HexeGem block that is being held on the side by touching the new block. You can do this at any time.</p>
<p>You may Pause the game by pressing the  menu button.</p>
