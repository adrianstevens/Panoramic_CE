<p><b>The game of Blackjack</b></p>
<p>Panoramic Blackjack allows you to play one player Blackjack much like you would in many casinos.  The goal of the game is to get 
a hand totaling as close to 21 as possible without "going over", as well as scoring more than the dealer.  The specific rules 
of the game vary depending on which difficulty setting you have selected.  Please see the <a href="PanoBlackjack.htm#Options">Options</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>The screen will show the dealer hand at the top, with the player hand below.  The buttons to control gameplay appear at the bottom.  You may press the Menu softkey at any time to exit.</p>
<p>To start a new game press "New Game" on the Menu screen.  Before you begin play you must first place a bet.  To place a bet, 
select or press one of the Bet buttons labeled $25, $50, $100, & $500.  You may not bet more than you currently have in your bank.  
You can always add to your existing Bet, but must hit Reset to Bet a lower amount. To start a hand select the Deal button.</p>
<p>Once the cards have been dealt you will be able to hit, stand, double, surrender, split or buy insurance depending on the cards 
dealt and the skill setting chosen.  </p>
<p><b>Controls</b></p>
<p>Blackjack may be played with or without a stylus (if your device supports it).  To play with a stylus, simply tap the on 
screen buttons to activate.</p>
<p>To play without a stylus, you have two options depending on your device.  To play with the 5-way control, press 
up/down/left/right to move the white onscreen selector.  Once the selector is around the button you wish to activate, press the 
center of the 5-way control.</p>
<p>For devices with a numeric keypad (ie, 0-9 buttons), all of the onscreen buttons are mapped to the physical buttons.  
During the bet stage, the buttons will do the following:
<p> 1 - Deal<br>
  2 - Reset<br>
  3 - Bet $25<br>
  4 - Bet $50<br>
  5 - Bet $100<br>
  6 - Bet $500<br>
<p>When a hand is in play the buttons will do the following:
<p>1 - Hit<br>
  2 - Stand<br>
  3 - Double (when available)<br>
  4 - Surrender (when available)<br>
  5 - Split (when available)<br>
  6 - Insurance (when available)<br>
<p><strong>Card Counting - The Count</strong>
<p>The idea behind counting cards in blackjack is that a deck of cards with a high proportion of high cards (ten-valued cards and aces) to low cards is good for the player, while the reverse (a deck with a high proportion of low cards to high cards) is good for the dealer. Basic card counting assigns a positive, negative, or zero value to each card. As each card is dealt, the running count (&quot;The Count&quot;) is adjusted by each card's assigned value. A deck rich in tens and aces improves the player's odds because blackjacks (which offer a higher payout than other winning hands) become more common, the dealer is more likely to bust a stiff hand, and double-downs are more successful.  *Please note - card counting may be considered cheating in some casinos. 
<p>Panoramic Blackjack uses the following counting systems:<br />

    <strong>Wizard Ace/Five:</strong> <br />
