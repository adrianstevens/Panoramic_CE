<p><a name="Tuner"></a><font size="6"><b>Tuner Screen</b></font>
<p>The Digital Tuner can be accessed by pressing the Tuner menu item.<br>
  The Tuner will allow you to tune a wide range of instruments by playing single notes.  Much like a stand alone digital tuner, this screen will display the Note, octive and relative pitch.<br>
  Make note of the signal quality bar, the bar will turn blue with a stronger, cleaner note is detected.  The frequency of the current note is displayed in the lower right of the screen.<br>
  You can adjust the Sample frequency and Trigger tolerance in the Options screen.  A higher sample frequency will improve note detection but decrease performance.  Also note, not all devices are able to sample at 44100Hz.  A higher trigger tolerance can be used to reduce the effects of background noise, a lower value will increase sensitivity.<br>
  <em>*Please note that Digital Tuner performance is effected by the processing power of the device as well as the quality of the microphone.  </em>
